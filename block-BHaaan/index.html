            <p> Play is such a crucial activity for children in order for them to develop properly. Itâ€™s how they naturally engage with the world and grow their body and mind.

                Parents shouldnâ€™t try to impede or limit the amount of play their kids may have. Of course, thatâ€™s as long as they take care of their school study and the screen time is limited.
                
                Here are some powerful quotes that emphasize the importance of playing for little ones:

                <p>
            Have fun trying to memorise menus in restaurants and cafÃ©s!
          Memorise directions to the swimming pool or to a friendâ€™s house using the right terms; 
          turn right, go over the roundabout, pass the sweet shop and itâ€™s second on the left.
           Play spelling pairs with your childâ€™s weekly spelling words. Draw a word grid and write each word in a new box. You will need to write each one twice (in separate boxes). Cut them out, making sure you have two of each spelling word. Then turn them over and mix them up. Challenge your child to turn over two pieces of paper and then read each word. Are they a pair? If not, turn them back over and repeat this until they find matching pairs. Once they have found a pair, 
           look at the spelling together and ask your child to spell the word without looking.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Draw a picture and then while you describe what you have drawn your child has to draw what you are describing. 
                    Compare your drawings.
                Make up riddles about an object or person you know and see if your child can guess what or who it is. 
                For example, â€˜They wear skirts, they have grey hair, and they live in a flat. Who are they?â€™
                Play â€˜Repeat the soundâ€™. Create a movement or sound (for example, click your fingers, tap your foot twice, or
                cough). Ask your child to copy you and add another movement or sound on at the end. You then have to repeat their 
                movement/sound and yours back and forth, without forgetting any. This game works with two or more players and is a great way to encourage 
                listening, memory, and concentration skills. It is also good fun!
