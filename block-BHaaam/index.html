### Create a website having 3 separate pages.

#### TODO üíª:

1. Create a multi-page website, having at least three pages connected.

2. Each page must have one header and footer.

3. In between the header and footer, there must be the main content of the page.

4. The main content must have at least two articles.

5. Each article must have one image.

6. Use different background colors for different pages.

7. Using CSS resets is necessary.

- use appropriate semantic tags and keep the nesting and indentation clean. -->

                Although there is no uniformly agreed upon definition, AI generally is thought 
                to refer to ‚Äúmachines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans,
                 given the human capacity for contemplation, judgment and intention.‚Äù[3] According to researchers 
                 Shubhendu and Vijay, these software systems ‚Äúmake decisions which normally require [a] human level of expertise‚Äù and help people 
                anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up.[4] As such, they operate in an intentional, intelligent, and adaptive manner.   
            </p>
            <p>AI is not a futuristic vision, but rather something that is here today 
                and being integrated with and deployed into a variety of sectors. This includes 
                fields such as finance, national security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, 
                and smart cities. There are numerous examples where AI already is making an impact on the 
                world and augmenting human capabilities in significant ways.[6]</p>
                <p>These examples from a variety of sectors demonstrate how AI is transforming many walks of human existence. The increasing penetration of AI and autonomous devices into many aspects of life is altering basic operations and decisionmaking within organizations, and improving efficiency and response times.

                    At the same time, though, these developments raise important policy, regulatory, and ethical issues. For example, 
                    how should we promote data access? How do we guard against biased or unfair data used in algorithms? What types of 
                    ethical principles are introduced through software programming, and how 
                    transparent should designers be about their choices? What about questions of legal liability in cases where algorithms 
                    cause harm?</p>

                <header>
                    <h2>This is our second </h2>

                <h3 class="example">Not an Easy Challenge</h3>
                <p>Leaving my previous job to pursue my goals meant that I had more time ‚Äî but it also meant that I had more on the line. Many people 
                    walk into this with big ambitions and give themselves lofty goals that they can‚Äôt reach. 
                    So for many people, sticking to the recommended one hour per day is probably best.

                    But what I‚Äôve observed is that even with the most basic criteria, most people who try this challenge fail. Many people start 
                    #100DaysOfCode with the aspiration of getting a job as a programmer (Literally tens of thousands of people from all over the world), 
                    but few of them actually achieve their goal.</p>
                <h3 class="example">The most important thing I did</h3>
                <p>You need to understand that when you have an ambitious goal like teaching yourself how to code, it‚Äôs going to require some sacrifices. 
                    You have to be willing to do that.

                    My social life often took a back seat, as did my video game time, and I was not keeping up with the latest hot show on Netflix. 
                    There were also days where I really didn‚Äôt feel like it, but I needed to make ‚Äúsome‚Äù progress.
                     You need to remind yourself that it‚Äôs all about delayed gratification, making short term sacrifices for long term gains.</p>
